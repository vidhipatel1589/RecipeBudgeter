let arr = [{"recipeID":1,"recipeName":"Cacio e pepe","description":"In a large pot, bring 8 cups water and the salt to a boil. This may feel like it’s not enough water, but it is! After you cook the pasta, the water will be concentrated with starch, which you'll use to thicken the sauce.\n\nCook the pasta until al dente, following package instructions. Use a measuring cup or ladle to reserve 2 cups of pasta cooking water. Then, drain the pasta into a colander set in the sink.\n\nWhile the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a large high-sided skillet set over medium heat. The butter will get foamy on top. Stir it continuously with a rubber spatula. In 2 to 4 minutes, (timing depends on how hot your skillet is) you’ll see brown bits form on the bottom of the skillet and the butter will smell nutty. Reduce the heat to low.\n\nImmediately, stir the black pepper into the brown butter and cook for 30 seconds to enhance its flavor. Carefully whisk in 1 cup of the reserved pasta water and cook for about 1 minute. Add the grated Pecorino Romano, 1/4 cup at a time, stirring constantly until the cheese is melted and the sauce looks smooth and creamy.\n\nAdd the cooked pasta to the skillet and toss to combine. If sauce looks dry, add more pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, until it evenly coats the pasta and looks creamy. Serve with extra ground black pepper, if you'd like.","userID":null},{"recipeID":2,"recipeName":"Triple Chocolate Cake","description":"Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)\nMake the cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt, and espresso powder (if using) together in a large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and vanilla together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. Batter is thin.\nDivide batter evenly between pans. Bake for 23-26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Baking times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. (Note: Even if they're completely done, the cooled cakes may *slightly* sink in the center. Cocoa powder is simply not as structurally strong as all-purpose flour and can’t hold up to all the moisture necessary to make a moist tasting chocolate cake. It’s normal!)\nRemove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely in the pan.\nMake the buttercream: With a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy—about 2 minutes. Add confectioners’ sugar, cocoa powder, 3 Tablespoons heavy cream, salt, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds, then increase to high speed and beat for 1 full minute. Do not over-whip. Add 1/4 cup more confectioners’ sugar or cocoa powder if frosting is too thin or 1-2 more Tablespoons of cream if frosting is too thick. (I usually add 1 more.) Taste. Add another pinch of salt if desired.\nAssemble and frost: If cooled cakes are domed on top, use a large serrated knife to slice a thin layer off the tops to create a flat surface. This is called “leveling” the cakes. Discard or crumble over finished cake. Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread remaining frosting all over the top and sides. I always use an icing spatula and bench scraper for the frosting. Garnish with chocolate chips, if desired.\nRefrigerate uncovered cake for at least 30-60 minutes before slicing to help set the shape. After that, you can serve the cake or continue refrigerating for up to 4–6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at room temperature or chilled.\"\nCover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.","userID":null},{"recipeID":3,"recipeName":"4 Step Orange Chicken","description":"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place frozen nuggets in a single layer on a baking sheet.\n\nBake in the preheated oven until hot and crispy, 11 to 13 minutes, or according to package directions.\n\nMeanwhile, whisk marmalade, BBQ sauce, and soy sauce together in a small saucepan and heat over low heat until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nPlace nuggets in a large bowl. Drizzle sauce over the top. Toss to coat.","userID":null},{"recipeID":4,"recipeName":"Easy Fluffy Pancakes","description":"To make pancakes, you'll whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Then, whisk melted butter, milk, egg, and vanilla in another. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour. As you stir, the batter will start to thicken and get bubbly (that's the baking powder beginning to work its magic!). Be careful not to mix too much, or your pancakes won't be as fluffy. We want to keep those bubbles. To cook your pancakes, heat a skillet or flat griddle to medium heat, melt some butter, and add your batter. The butter gives them amazing crispy edges! You can use a 1/4 cup measure or a large cookie scoop to scoop the pancake batter into your skillet. Flip the pancakes when the edges look dry, and bubbles appear and pop on the top surfaces. They'll need 1 to 2 minutes on each side. If you notice them browning too quickly, reduce the heat a little (I stay around medium heat). Top with fresh fruits and syrup!","userID":null},{"recipeID":5,"recipeName":"Quick Quesadillas","description":"Step 1: Top half of each tortilla with 1/4 cup cheese, 2 teaspoons green onions and 1 tablespoon salsa.  Brush the edges of the tortillas with water.  Fold the tortillas over the filling and press to seal. Step 2: Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.  Add the quesadillas and cook in batches until lightly browned on both sides and the cheese is melted.  Serve with the remaining salsa.","userID":null}];
